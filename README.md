how to use

run the program using 'python3 Main.py' in a termainl

you will be prompted to sign up or log in, to sign up you type sign-up. to login you type login.

once you sign up you will have to run the program again to either sign up a second time or log in

if you type wipe at the first prompt it will wipe all the login data.
